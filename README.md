=====================================

See it working: http://mkv25.net/showcase/whatcolourisit/

Based on this idea, but with scaled colour values: http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/

Coming soon:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>What Colour Is It - Australia Version</title>
</head>
<body>
	<whatcolourisit class="block" label="Australia" timeZoneOffset="660"></whatcolourisit>
	<script src="http://webcomponents.mkv25.net/whatcolourisit/colour.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The files for the above demo have not yet been hosted, but hopefully you can see the intent; the new whatiscolourblock can be added to the page, and the script enables the page to understand how to render and run the new component.
